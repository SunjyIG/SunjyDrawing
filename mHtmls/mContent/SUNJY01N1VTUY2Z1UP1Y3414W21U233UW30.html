The only Gothic altarpiece in the Metropolitan’s collection with all of its components, this work was painted for Alderotto Brunelleschi’s chapel in the church of San Leo in Florence. He and his uncle Silvestro are portrayed in the predella. In the main panels are Saints Bernard and Sylvester, and Nicholas and Julian flank the central scene where Christ crowns his mother accompanied by angel musicians. The roundels above contain busts of unidentified prophets and of Christ. The scenes in the predella show the apostles Peter and Paul appearing to Constantine in a dream and Pope Sylvester baptizing Constantine, Sylvester raising the bull, and Sylvester binding the mouth of a poisonous dragon and resuscitating magicians killed by the dragon’s breath.</p>');
