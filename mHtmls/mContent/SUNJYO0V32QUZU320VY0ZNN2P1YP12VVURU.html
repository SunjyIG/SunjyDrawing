This miniature altarpiece relates to the cult of the Virgin of the Rosary. Depicted in the upper registers are fifteen mysteries associated with the Virgin&#39;s life: five joyful, five sorrowful, and five glorious. The scene at the base illustrates a miracle by which a man was saved from death when he prayed to the Virgin of the Rosary. Each Hail Mary he recited became a rose that the Christ Child then wove into a garland. The background landscape portrays the Coudenberg Palace in Brussels, suggesting that the picture was commissioned by a member of the Habsburg court, possibly the lords of Ravensteyn.</p>');
