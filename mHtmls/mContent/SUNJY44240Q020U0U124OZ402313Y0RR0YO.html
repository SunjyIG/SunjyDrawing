document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“At the Moulin-Rouges, Two Women Waltzing” by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec depicts actual people from the Parisian nightlife at Montmartre at the end of the 19th century. The female clown Cha-U-Kao is one of the women dancing, and the singer Jane Avril is behind her, with her back to the spectator. Toulouse-Lautrec imbued his personal experience in his paintings set at the Moulin-Rouge. Although he was born into an aristocratic family, he identified himself with people from all parts of French society.<br><br>The Moulin-Rouge was founded in 1889. At the time of this painting, it was housed in a building, which burned down in 1915. It was close to Montmartre in Paris, with a red windmill on its roof that marks it. Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a kind of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe.<br><br>Today, the Moulin Rouge is a tourist attraction, offering musical dance entertainment for visitors from around the world. The club’s decor still contains much of the romance of the end of 19th century France.<br></p>');
