The heightened realism of this portrait, especially the beard stubble, is a hallmark of his work. By setting the man’s head against a dark interior, next to a bright window, the accentuated contrast of light and shadow enhances the modeling of the facial features. The portrait was later cut into an oval shape from a rectangular panel, which probably originally formed part of a devotional triptych. The sitter, with his hands joined in eternal prayer, directs his gaze toward the missing religious image.</p>');
