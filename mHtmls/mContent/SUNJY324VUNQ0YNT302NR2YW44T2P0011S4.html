Weighing gold coins while dressed in expensive fur, the sitter may have been one of the many merchants in Bruges who handled commodities, a money changer, or a banker, like Tommaso Portinari. In contrast to Memling’s portrait, the source of this sitter’s wealth is part of the subject, and the man is defined by his profession, not his piety. Isenbrant occupied a prominent position in Bruges, and ran a busy shop that produced works for both the local market and the export trade.</p>');
