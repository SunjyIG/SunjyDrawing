The daughter of King Philip IV of Spain, María Teresa became the presumptive heir to the throne in 1646. Princely suitors from around Europe were keen to have a portrait of the young infanta as she reached marriageable age. Originally bust length but subsequently cut down and then reenlarged at the bottom, this likeness of María Teresa wearing a wig with butterfly ribbons may have served as a model for Velázquez&#39;s assistants to copy as they met the demand for official portraits of the young princess. Few, however, could approximate the brilliant flicker of his brush, so evident here. In 1660 the infanta married Louis XIV, her first cousin, becoming queen of France.</p>');
