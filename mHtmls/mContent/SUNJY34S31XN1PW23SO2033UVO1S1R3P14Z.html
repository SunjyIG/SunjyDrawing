By the 1750s, Boucher was associated with a number of signature motifs, perhaps none more so than allegorical putti suspended midair. When given attributes alluding to a season, element, or one of the arts, they provided flexible decorative programs. Frequently Boucher himself participated only minimally in the production of these decorative canvases, allowing his workshop to execute the painting on his behalf. Nonetheless, as here, he sometimes signed such works. Unusual shapes known as chantourné, or cutout, formats allowed these paintings to function apiece with the Rococo carving of the surrounding panels. <br></p>');
