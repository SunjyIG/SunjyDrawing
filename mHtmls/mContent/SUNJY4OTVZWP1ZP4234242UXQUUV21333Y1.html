The background of the story is that the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar had looted the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>He stole the sacred artifacts, such as the golden cups, from the Temple. In Book of Daniel, his son Belshazzar used these cups for a great feast. During the feast, the hand of God appeared and wrote an inscription on the wall.<br><br>Belshazzar and his advisers were not able to decipher the inscription and had to send for Daniel to help them with the translation. The inscription on the wall states:<br><br>“God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end.<br> You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting.<br> Your kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.”<br><br>This painting was Rembrandt’s attempt to establish himself as a painter of large, baroque history paintings.<br><br>Rembrandt’s technique is exceptional, and his palette was unusually rich, encompassing such pigments as vermilion, smalt, lead-tin-yellow, yellow and red lakes, ochres, and azurite.<br><br>Rembrandt lived in the Jewish Quarter of Amsterdam and derived the Hebrew inscription from a book by his friend, the Rabbi, and printer, Menasseh ben Israel.<br><br>Rembrandt mistranscribed one of the characters and arranged them in columns, rather than right to left, as Hebrew is written.<br><br>In 1834 the painting was stolen from its then-owner, a picture dealer living in London.
