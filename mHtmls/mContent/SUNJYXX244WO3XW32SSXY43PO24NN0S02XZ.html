document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, 1783. This oil sketch is a precious record of a ceiling in Genoa’s ducal palace that was destroyed in the 1860s. Tiepolo’s composition can be compared with his father’s ceiling design for Würzburg, which Domenico helped to execute (see the oil sketch for that painting nearby). The younger Tiepolo depicted a Giustiniani family patriarch, Jacopo, at the top of a staircase, kneeling before a personification of the Ligurian Republic. At left is a female personification of the Aegean island of Chios, which the Giustiniani family ruled for two centuries. At right, figures in exoticized dress of turbans and loose pants with moustaches and beards allude to the family’s commercial enterprises in Asia Minor.</p>');
