It symbolized the secret affair Rossetti was immersed in with Jane Morris at the time. She was the model for several of Rossetti’s well-known paintings.<br><br>This painting is one of Rossetti’s last and one of his few full-length depictions during this time of his career. The painting is signed “D. Rossetti 1880” on the lower right.<br><br>The scene is a representation of a woman in a green silk dress, shaded by the canopy of the sycamore tree’s leaves. All around her, the tree branches are depicted as if they want to embrace her.<br><br>Rossetti portrayed her clad all in green, her dress is a loose silk robe, flowing in folds and blending in with the tree’s leaves.<br><br>She is immersed in her daydreams, turning her gaze towards something unseen or perceived by her.<br><br>Rossetti made several revisions to the painting to meet his exacting expectations, including copying the feet of another woman to the picture.<br><br>The depiction of the woman in her shelter surrounded by the branches adds to the mystery of the painting, symbolizing the secrecy of their affair. <br><br>Rossetti completed a chalk sketch of Morris a few years earlier in 1878. Initially, the painting was to be called Monna Primavera, or Vanna Primavera, inspired by La Vita Nuova, a narrative that captivated Rossetti.<br><br>Rossetti penned sonnets to accompany several of his paintings. His last poem in his series entitled “Sonnets for Pictures” is associated with this painting. <br><br>Within the branching shade of Reverie<br>Dreams even may spring till autumn; yet none be<br>Like woman’s budding day-dream spirit-fann’d.<br>Lo! tow’rd deep skies, not deeper than her look,<br>She dreams; till now on her forgotten book<br>Drops the forgotten blossom from her hand.<br></p>');
