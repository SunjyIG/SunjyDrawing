With characteristic business acumen, Rubens created a market for a new art form: very large hunting scenes painted on canvas, of which this one is the first. The few earlier examples were either models for or copies after tapestries, but Rubens’s large &#34;hunts&#34; of about 1616–21 were made as replacements for that very expensive medium. This canvas, originally more symmetrical in design, was trimmed at the top and left side because (according to a client in 1616) &#34;none but great Princes have houses fitt to hange it up in.&#34; Rubens painted the picture with the help of assistants but declared that the wolves were his own work.</p>');
