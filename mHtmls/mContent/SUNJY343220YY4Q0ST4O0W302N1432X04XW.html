document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Gassed” by John Singer Sargent depicts the aftermath of a mustard gas attack during the First World War. The oil painting completed one year after the end of WWI shows a line of wounded soldiers walking towards a dressing station.<br><br>The composition is focused on a central group of eleven soldiers depicted nearly life-size. The wounded soldiers walk in a line, in three groups of three, along a duckboard towards a dressing station, suggested by the guy ropes to the right side of the picture.<br><br>The gas has temporarily blinded their eyes, so medical orderlies had to assist them.<br><br>Many dead and wounded soldiers lie around the central group.  Another train of injured, with orderlies, advances in the background on the right.<br><br>Biplanes dogfight in the evening sky above, as the setting sun creates a yellow haze that burnishes the subjects with a golden light.<br><br>In the background, the moon is rising, and several men play football in blue and red shirts, as a distraction from the carnage all around them.<br><br>Sargent was commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee to document the war.<br><br>Although Sargent was 62, he traveled to the Western Front in mid-1918, spending time with the English Guards Division near Arras, and then with the American Expeditionary Forces near Ypres.<br><br>As an American painter, Sargent was asked to create a work embodying Anglo-American co-operation.<br><br>He was determined to paint an epic work but struggled to find a mass of American and British figures in the same scene. Sargent wrote:<br><br>“How can one do an epic without masses of men? … one a harrowing sight, a field full of gassed and blindfolded men.”<br><br>One of the commanders during the incident that Sargent witnesses described the events as:<br><br>“Without warning, a considerable number of officers and men were ‘gassed’ and temporarily placed hors de combat. As the unfortunate victims were being helped, practically blinded, by their comrades on a field ambulance, John Sergeant happened to arrive on the scene. Shortly before, he had told me that he had been commissioned to paint a picture which should be typical of the war, and I suggested ‘tanks,’ they being the latest military machine and a novel feature of it.” However, … on seeing the gassed soldiers being led to the ambulance, “he decided that he has before him what he was seeking”.<br><br>Mustard Gas<br><br>Mustard Gas is a chemical warfare agent, which can form large blisters on exposed skin and in the lungs.
