Georgiana Augusta Frederica was the daughter of Grace Dalrymple Elliott (whose portrait by Gainsborough at the Museum (20.155.1) is exhibited in Gallery 2). The record of her christening names George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales (later George IV) as her father, although her father may actually have been the 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley. She was reared in the Cholmondeley family and married William Charles Bentinck (1780–1826), third son of the 3rd Duke of Portland, in 1808, five years before her death at the age of thirty-one. Painted during the sitter&#39;s third year in 1784, the portrait is particularly well perserved.</p>');
