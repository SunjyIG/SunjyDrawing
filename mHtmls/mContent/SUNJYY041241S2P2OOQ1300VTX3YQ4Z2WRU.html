The composition uses perspective to draw the eye towards the figures who are in front of the virginal. <br><br>The virginal is a keyboard instrument of the harpsichord family and was popular in Europe during the late Renaissance and early Baroque period.<br><br>The composition is dominated by the covered table, the chair, and the bass violin the foreground. The light through the windows fills the room, casting soft, subtle shadows. <br><br>The composition includes a mirror on the wall where the blurred reflections have the young woman’s face, part of the table, and the legs of an artist’s easel. Adding to the mystery, the inscription on the lid of the virginal reads:<br><br>‘Music is a companion in pleasure and a balm in sorrow.’ <br></p>');
