It is a brilliant color creation.<br><br>The composition is an enduring expression of tenderness and love. The couple’s embrace is at the center of this poignant painting.<br><br>The man’s loving gesture is returned with a gentle caress. The couple shows all the signs of tenderness towards each other, so this is not a typical seduction scene, which was a favorite at the time.<br><br>This painting shows Rembrandt’s genius for expressing human emotion and is one of the great portrait paintings of the last period of his career.<br><br>Vincent van Gogh said of this painting:<br><br>“I should be happy to give ten years of my life, if I could go on sitting here in front of this picture for a fortnight, with only a crust of dry bread for food.”<br></p>');
