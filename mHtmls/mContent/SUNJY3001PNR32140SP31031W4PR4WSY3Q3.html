document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Gerrit Dou, ca. 1665. Dou was Rembrandt’s first pupil, only seven years younger than his master. The older artist inspired his student’s lifelong commitment to self-portraiture, often in fanciful or theatrical costume. In some self-portraits, Dou adopted the guise of an aristocrat, but here he proudly displays the tools of his trade. Rather than adopt Rembrandt’s signature rough manner of painting, Dou became famous for his jewel-like surfaces and painstaking method, qualities that led Philips Angel to single him out as an exemplary artist in his lecture &#34;The Praise of Painting.&#34; </p>');
