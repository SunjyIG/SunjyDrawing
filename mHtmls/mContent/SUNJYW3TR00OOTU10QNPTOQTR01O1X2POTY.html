The sitter was an artist who exhibited regularly at the Salon and was also the author of popular drawing manuals. At the time Ingres painted her, she was married to one of his pupils, Clément Boulanger (1805–1842). Traces of a curving edge on the surface of the canvas indicate that the portrait had been framed as an oval before Ingres added the dedication to her as Madame Cavé, which must have taken place a decade later, after she remarried. Ingres’s 1844 portrait of Monsieur Cavé was conceived as a pendant to the present work.</p>');
