document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Paolo Veronese (Paolo Caliari), ca. 1580. In this portrait, the greatest Venetian sculptor of the later sixteenth century, Alessandro Vittoria, is recorded by the greatest painter of his generation, Paolo Veronese. Vittoria is shown with the model for one of his most famous statues, the Saint Sebastian, carved in 1561–62 for the church of San Francesco della Vigna in Venice. This figure was later cast by Vittoria twice as a bronze statuette. Vittoria had portraits of himself holding his own sculpture painted by eminent artists at various times in his life; five were hung near the studio in his house where they could be seen by clients and visitors. This portrait was done around 1580 when the sculptor was about fifty-five.</p>');
