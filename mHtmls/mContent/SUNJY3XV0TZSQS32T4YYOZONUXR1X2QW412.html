This sculpture depicts a pair of lovers caught in a floating embrace.<br><br>Their outstretched and graceful limbs are in sharp contrast to the compact, inward-focused sculpture of “The Kiss.”<br><br>This sculpture has an air of weightless and floating quality, which makes it a perfect ode to springtime love. Rodin created Eternal Springtime at a time when he was in a romantic relationship with Camille Claudel.<br><br>It is claimed that traces of Camille can be discerned in the women of this masterpiece and other female figures prominent in the works Rodin created in the mid-1880s. This work was reproduced several times in bronze and marble.<br></p>');
