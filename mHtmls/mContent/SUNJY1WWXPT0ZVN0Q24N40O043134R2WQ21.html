document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Camille Corot, 1870. Corot often painted views of the large pond on the property he had inherited from his parents at Ville-d&#39;Avray. In repeating the scene, he took certain liberties, especially with the tree just left of center. The silhouette of branches and foliage against the pewter sky led Corot&#39;s biographer Alfred Robaut to liken this work to a spider&#39;s web. Corot initially included a child with outstretched arms beside the crouching peasant woman, but he seems to have found this detail too anecdotal. Critics admired the calm poetry of this composition when it was first exhibited at the 1870 Salon.</p>');
