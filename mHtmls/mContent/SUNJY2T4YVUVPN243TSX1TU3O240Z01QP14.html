In 1862, having been awarded a prize by Madrid’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Rico traveled to Paris to develop his talent for landscape painting, eventually choosing to study with Charles-François Daubigny. This view, which he painted along the river Seine at Poissy in 1869, adopts one of Daubigny’s most characteristic picture types: an emphatically horizontal river view. Yet Rico’s smooth brushwork and precise realism reflect an awareness of contemporary photography that is entirely his own. In his autobiography, Rico wrote that &#34;the delicate colors of the banks of the Seine and the Marne are not easily found elsewhere.&#34;</p>');
