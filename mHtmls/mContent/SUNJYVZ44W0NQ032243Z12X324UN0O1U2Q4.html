The right porch scene shows the discovery of the death of Lucretia.<br><br>The statue at the top of the column is David with Goliath’s head. “David and Goliath” were a symbol of revolt against tyranny in the Republic of Florence.<br><br>According to legend, Brutus grabbed the dagger from Lucretia’s breast after her death and immediately shouted for the overthrow of the King.<br><br>Brutus took an oath to expel the King from Rome and never to allow anyone else to reign again as King. This revolt against tyranny, made Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome.<br><br>In the center of the painting is Lucretia, with the dagger with which she killed herself protruding from her breast.
