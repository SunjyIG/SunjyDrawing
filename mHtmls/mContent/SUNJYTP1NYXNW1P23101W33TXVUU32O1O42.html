document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />The Mystical Nativity by Sandro Botticelli depicts the joy and celebration of earthly and heavenly delight at the birth of Jesus. The angels are dancing at the top of the painting, and above them is Botticelli’s name, but also some apocalyptic and troubling words. Botticelli believed himself to be living during the Great Tribulation due to the upheavals in Europe at the time and the preaching of the time that was predicting Christ’s return, as stated in the Bible. It is Botticelli’s only signed work and has an unusual iconography for a Nativity.<br><br>The painting has some dark symbolic premonitions, including:<br>•the baby Jesus rests on a sheet that evokes his death shroud;<br>•the cave echoes his tomb;<br>•the Kings on the left bear no gifts;<br>•at the bottom of the painting, three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them from the ground;<br>•at the very bottom of the canvas, seven devils flee to the underworld; and<br>•some of the devils impaled on their weapons.<br><br>On the reassuring side, the painting includes the following:<br>•at the top of the picture twelve angels dressed in the colors of faith, hope and charity dance in a circle;<br>•the angels are holding olive branches;<br>•above the angels, heaven opens in a great golden dome;<br>•the symbolism of the gold is the unchanging, untarnished nature of heaven; and<br>•the angels at the bottom are holding scrolls which proclaim in Latin, “Peace on earth to men of goodwill.”<br><br>The painting uses the medieval convention of showing the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus larger than other figures. This emphasis was certainly done deliberately for effect, as earlier Botticelli nativity paintings used the correct graphical perspective. The Greek inscription at the top translates as:<br><br>“This picture, at the end of the year 1500, in the troubles of Italy, I Alessandro, in the half-time after the time, painted, according to the eleventh [chapter] of Saint John, in the second woe of the Apocalypse, during the release of the devil for three-and-a-half years; then he shall be bound in the twelfth [chapter], and we shall see [him buried] as in this picture”.<br></p>');
