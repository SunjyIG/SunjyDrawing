California sea otters, once thought wiped out by the fur trade, are booming again in a federally-protected enclave of Northern California coast. But outside that sanctuary, a new study finds, a chain of unintended bad consequences has followed man's removal of otters as a top predator of the sea, and is preventing the furry creature's return to its former range from Baja California north.

When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to individually  "transplant " onto a reef, a process akin to planting each blade of grass in a lawn separately. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year. And it's not possible to simply scatter seeds. (David J.
