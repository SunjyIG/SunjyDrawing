document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, 1853. This picture illustrates the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan, who comes to the aid of a wounded man. Having dressed the man’s wounds, the Samaritan is shown carrying him to an inn, where he would pay for the man’s care. The present version was admired by Delacroix in 1853, as Decamps was preparing to close up his Paris studio and retire to Fontainebleau. Its thickly impasted surface is characteristic of Decamps’s late manner, in which subjects of profound moral import are treated with formal austerity.</p>');
