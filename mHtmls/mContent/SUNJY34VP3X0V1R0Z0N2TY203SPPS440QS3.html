document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Charles Jacque, 1857. The barn depicted here is thought to have been owned by a friend of Jacque’s in or near the village of Barbizon. Jacque had moved there from Paris in 1849, settling next door to Jean-François Millet, whose subject matter and painting style he adopted. Yet Jacque’s approach was more literal and descriptive than Millet’s. He came fully into his own with rustic scenes such as this one, in which the abundance of prosaic details is harmonized through the warm glow of sunlight. The chickens are more than incidental: in addition to painting Jacque also tried his hand as a poultry farmer.</p>');
