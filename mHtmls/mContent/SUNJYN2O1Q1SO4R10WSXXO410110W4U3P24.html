The motif of the Virgin and Child is based on a celebrated work by Jan van Eyck, but with the addition of a figure of Saint Joseph. The wine and fruits are a reference to Christ&#39;s incarnation and sacrifice. Yet, presented as part of everyday life, they also testify to the emerging genre of still-life painting. The combination of quotidian domestic intimacy and symbolic meaning must have had mass appeal, since many variations of this painting were produced for sale on the open market.</p>');
