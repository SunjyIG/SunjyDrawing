Surveying the view from his lodgings at the Grand Hôtel de Russie in early 1897, Pissarro marveled that he could &#34;see down the whole length of the boulevards&#34; with &#34;almost a bird&#39;s-eye view of carriages, omnibuses, people, between big trees, big houses that have to be set straight.&#34; From February through April, he recorded—in two scenes of the boulevard des Italiens to the right, and fourteen of the boulevard Montmartre to the left—the spectacle of urban life as it unfolded below his window. </p>');
