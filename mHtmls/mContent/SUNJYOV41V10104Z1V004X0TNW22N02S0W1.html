document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Isabella” by John Everett Millais depicts a scene in the relationship between Isabella, the sister of wealthy merchants, and their poor apprentice Lorenzo.<br><br>It shows the moment at which Isabella’s jealous brothers realize that there is a romance between the two young people. The brothers later plot to murder Lorenzo so they can marry Isabella to a wealthy nobleman.<br><br>The painting illustrates an episode from a 1300s story which was reprised by John Keats in poem form.<br><br>In the painting, Isabella is being handed a blood orange on a plate by the doomed Lorenzo, signifying the later spilling of Lorenzo’s blood. <br><br>One of her brothers kicks a frightened dog while cracking a nut and leaning forward in an upturned chair. The painting is structured with a deliberately distorted perspective, elongating the right-hand side of the table.<br><br>This artwork was Millais’s first work in the Pre-Raphaelite style, created shortly after the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848.<br><br>The base of the bench on which Isabella sits has a carving depicting a kneeling figure under which appear the letters PRB which stand for Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. This painting was the first to incorporate the Pre-Raphaelite initials.<br><br>A distinctive Pre-Raphaelite feature is the hidden symbolism in their paintings. Experts claim several hidden phallic symbols in this picture, mainly surrounding the frustrated brother on the front left.<br><br>Critics argue that the critical symbol is the shadow on the table near his crotch area, below his elbow and the related body language.<br></p>');
