For Michelangelo, a sculpture was buried in the marble and had to be extracted through the sculptor’s skill.

The symbolistic title of this piece links it to a whole series of works focus on hands, made during the 1890s, such as the Cathedral and the Secret.<br><br>During his career, Rodin modeled thousands of hands as small clay studies. For Rodin, the hand and the interplay of hands within groups of figures were expressive components of his sculptures.<br><br>Rodin imbued hands with a range of emotions, from anger and despair to compassion and kindness. He kept many hand clay studies in his studio, where he would contemplate them as sculptural forms in space. Rodin stated that he felt an:<br><br>“intense passion for the expression of the human hands.”<br><br>When Rodin composed a new figure, he often experimented with different hands at varying angles to explore the possibilities of new expressive combinations.<br><br>This approach reinforced Rodin’s interest in the partial figure, and he felt that representations of parts of the body, such as the hand, are not necessarily dependent upon a complete figure to convey meaning.<br></p>');
