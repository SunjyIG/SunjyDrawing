The marine theme was of interest to Homer for more than a decade as he often vacationed in Florida, Cuba, and the Caribbean. Homer crossed the Gulf Stream many times, and his trips usually inspired several related works. A visit to Nassau and Florida preceded this painting and being the year after the death of his father. It may be revealing his sense of vulnerability.</p>');
