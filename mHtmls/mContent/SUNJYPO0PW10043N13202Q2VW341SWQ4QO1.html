The composition of this small roundel of the Virgin suckling the Christ Child was very popular: it derives from a composition by Robert Campin that was disseminated through workshop patterns.

Roundels like this were often hung above the heads of beds, where they served as a blessing over a married couple or as a focus for personal prayer.
