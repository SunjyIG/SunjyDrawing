document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama” by Édouard Manet commemorates the Battle of Cherbourg of 1864, which was a naval engagement of the American Civil War.<br><br>The naval battle was between the Union cruiser USS Kearsarge and the Confederate raider CSS Alabama. Many spectators were able to see the action from the coast of France and saw the USS Kearsarge sink CSS Alabama.<br><br>Within one month of this battle, Manet had completed this painting, even though he had not witnessed the action himself. Manet relied on press descriptions of the battle and visits to Cherbourg to see the Kearsarge and compose this artwork. <br><br>This painting was the first known seascape by Manet with his imaginative depiction of the naval battle fought off the coast of France. The C.S.S. Alabama, the scourge of Union shipping, is shown sinking by her stern.<br><br>Smoke is rising from a direct hit to C.S.S. Alabama’s engines by the U.S.S. Kearsarge, which is mostly obscured from view by the smoke clouds.<br><br>This picture was first displayed in the window of a print shop in Paris in July 1864, a month after the event, demonstrating Manet’s quick response to a sensational and recent news story.<br><br>The Battle of Cherbourg (1864)<br><br>The Battle of Cherbourg was a single-ship action fought between a United States Navy warship, USS Kearsarge, and a Confederate States Navy warship, CSS Alabama, in 1864, off Cherbourg, France.<br><br>After several successful commerce raiding missions in the Atlantic Ocean, the CSS Alabama turned into Cherbourg Harbor on June 11, 1864.<br><br>The Captain intended to drydock his ship and conduct repairs at the French port. The Confederate Navy vessel was crewed by about 170 men and armed with six 32-pounder (15 kg) cannon.<br><br>The CSS Alabama was pursued for two years by the screw sloop-of-war USS Kearsarge. Kearsarge was armed with two 11-inch (279 mm) smoothbore Dahlgren guns. Around 150 sailors and officers operated her.<br><br>On June 14, Kearsarge finally caught up with Alabama as she was receiving repairs. Kearsarge did not attack, as Alabama was in a neutral port; instead, she blockaded the CSS Alabama in Cherbourg.<br><br>On June 19, CSS Alabama, with nowhere else to go, she exited the harbor to attack Kearsarge. She was escorted by the French Navy ironclad Couronne, whose mission was to ensure that the ensuing battle occurred outside the French port.<br><br>The Kearsarge turned around to take the impending battle out of French territorial waters. Once outside national water, the USS Kearsarge turned about again and lined up for a broadside. <br><br>CSS Alabama fired the first shots with little impact. The Kearsarge closed to within 1,000 yards (910 m) when she fired her first shot.
