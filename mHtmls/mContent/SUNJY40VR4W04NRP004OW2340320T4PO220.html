This work was painted in 1789, but Lemoine could not show it at the Salon until 1796, when post-Revolutionary reforms greatly expanded women artists’ access to the privileges of the Académie Royale. The painting’s title suggests that it could help the public imagine any number of women in this profession, but those close to the artist most likely recognized a self-portrait alongside her sister, Marie-Elisabeth, who was also a painter. Lemoine’s facility in still life and portraiture, categories in which women most often trained, are readily visible, while a history painting—the highest category in the academic system and usually considered in this period as ill-suited to women—is underway on the easel.</p>');
