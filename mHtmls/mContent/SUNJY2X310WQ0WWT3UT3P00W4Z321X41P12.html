Bruegel’s depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and examples of Roman engineering, is reminiscent of a larger and taller Roman Colosseum.<br><br>Bruegel had visited Rome in 1552–1553 and had studied the Roman ruins. At first glance, the tower appears to be a steady series of concentric pillars. However, none of the layers lies at a true horizontal. The tower is built as an ascending spiral.<br><br>Christians of the time of this painting saw the Roman Colosseum as a symbol of hubris and persecution. The parallels between Rome and Babylon had a significance for Bruegel’s audience.<br><br>Rome was the Eternal City, intended to last forever, and its decay and ruin were taken to symbolize the vanity and transience of earthly efforts. <br><br>The Tower of Babel was also symbolic of the religious turmoil between the Catholic church and the Protestant religion. The Protestant denomination was growing in strength in the Netherlands.<br><br>The Tower of Babel is a Near Eastern origination story recorded in Genesis. It is meant to explain the origin of different languages.<br><br>According to the story, united humanity that had developed after the Great Flood and speaking a single language agreed to build a city and a tower “tall enough to reach heaven.”<br><br>“Then they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves’…” (Genesis 11:4).<br><br>This arrogance angered God, and he confused their speech so that they could no longer understand each other and scattered them around the world.<br><br>The Tower of Babel was the subject of three paintings by Pieter Bruegel, the Elder.
