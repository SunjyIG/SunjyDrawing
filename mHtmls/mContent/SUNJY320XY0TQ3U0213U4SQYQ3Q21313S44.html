Sauvage’s name was synonymous with trompe l’oeil (fool the eye) paintings that imitated the low relief carvings in ancient sculpture that became hugely popular during the Neoclassical period. In this unusual example, Sauvage used a thick slate support to which he added oil paint in imitation of wax, a flexible medium often used by sculptors who were working out a composition before they began carving in unforgiving stone. The result is a brilliant play on artistic process and the differences between painting and sculpture, a recurrent comparison in the Western tradition.</p>');
