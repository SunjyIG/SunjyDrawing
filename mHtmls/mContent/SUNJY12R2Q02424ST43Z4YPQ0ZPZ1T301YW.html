This statue of the frantic Saint Veronica displaying the Veil of Veronica is one of the four larger-than-life sculptures which frame the Baldacchino in the transept of St. Peter’s Basilica.

Various existing images have been claimed to be the “original” relic or early copies of it.<br><br>According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy when she saw Jesus carrying his cross to Golgotha and gave him her veil, that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her. The image of his face was miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the Veil of Veronica.<br><br>The Statue of Saint Veronica is one of these four statues. <br></p>');
