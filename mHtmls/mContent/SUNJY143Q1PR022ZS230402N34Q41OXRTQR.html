Primarily known for his religious and genre subjects, Murillo was also a talented portraitist who used softly modeled, smoky shadows in order to suggest his sitters’ psychological depth. Little is known of Don Andrés de Andrade y la Cal, whose name and coat of arms are included as trompe l&#39;oeil carving. The artist adopted Titian&#39;s and Velázquez’s formulae for royal portraiture, including the grand architectural setting and hunt dog, known as a perdiguero.
