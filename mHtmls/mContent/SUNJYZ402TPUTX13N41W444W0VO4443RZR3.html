document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Pierre Paul Prud&#39;hon. Prud’hon—a principal representative of Neoclassicism, who typically painted in this smoky, sfumato technique—was working on this canvas in 1814 and planned to sell it to the former empress of France, Marie Louise. Still incomplete when Prud’hon died, it was finished by his little known pupil, Charles Pompée Le Boulanger de Boisfrémont. The subject of family devotion is taken from French tragedian Racine: Andromache embraces her son, Astyanax, in whom she sees the features of her husband, Hector, who had been slain by Achilles. When mother and son were retained as spoils of war, Achilles’s son, Pyrrhus, fell in with her, though as his surprised gesture here indicates, she rejected his advances.</p>');
