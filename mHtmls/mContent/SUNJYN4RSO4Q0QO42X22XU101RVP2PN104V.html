document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Anton Mauve, ca. 1880s. In the second half of the nineteenth century, The Hague became the center of a major school of landscape painting. Its principal members were the Maris brothers, Josef Israels, H. W. Mesdag, and Mauve, who settled in The Hague in 1874. Inspired by J. F. Millet and other members of the Barbizon School, whose work could be seen in the Goupil Gallery in The Hague and in Mesdag&#39;s personal collection, they shared a commitment to record the peasant life, gray skies, and flat terrain of their native country. Changing Pasture reflects these interests and is a characteristic work of the last decade of Mauve&#39;s life.</p>');
