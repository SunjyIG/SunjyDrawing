According to a list of Fantin&#39;s paintings compiled by his wife, this still life is one of thirty-one compositions of flowers and fruit that the artist produced in 1874. The branch of apples suggests that the present picture was painted in the fall; the pansies are spring flowers that were probably cultivated in a hothouse. Fantin reprised elements seen here in at least two other paintings: Potted Pansies of 1883 and Pansies of 1903.</p>');
