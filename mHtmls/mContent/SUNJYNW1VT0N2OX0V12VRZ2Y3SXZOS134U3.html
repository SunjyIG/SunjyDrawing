document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Garofalo (Benvenuto Tisi da Garofalo), ca. 1530. These two scenes from the life of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, a thirteenth-century Augustinian saint, were part of the predella of an altarpiece in the Muzzarelli chapel in the church of Sant’Andrea in Ferrara, at the center of which was a sculpture of the saint. They show two of the saint’s many miracles, one in which he revived a child who had died before being baptized and another in which, despite being bedridden and unwell, he refused to eat cooked partridges that subsequently flew away. The scenes are noteworthy for their effects of light and the beauty of the simple spaces in which the saint carries out his miracles.</p>');
