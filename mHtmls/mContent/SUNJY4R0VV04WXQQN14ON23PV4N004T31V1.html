document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellee), 1648–50. In its immediacy and breadth of handling, this small painting recalls drawings that Claude made from nature in the environs of Rome. The composition is illustrated in the painter’s drawn record book of his work, the Liber Veritatis. The building, which still stands in the outskirts of Rome, was a medieval fortress transformed into a country house, which in the seventeenth century belonged to the aristocratic Crescenzi family. The painting is unique in that it accurately represents an existing building and is not drawn from the artist’s imagination.</p>');
