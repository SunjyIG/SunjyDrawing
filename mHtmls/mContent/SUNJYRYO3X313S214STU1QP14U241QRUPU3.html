document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Leonardo da Vinci. The “Madonna Litta” painting has traditionally been attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. However, scholarly opinion is divided on the work’s creators. Some experts believe this is the work of one of Leonardo’s pupils. The Hermitage Museum, which owns this 1490s masterpiece, considers the painting to be an autograph work by Leonardo. Madonna Litta depicts the Virgin Mary breastfeeding the Christ child, a devotional subject known as the Nursing Madonna. The figures are set in a dark interior with two arched openings showing an aerial view of a mountainous landscape. Of particular interest, note that in the center of the painting, in Christ’s left hand, is a goldfinch, which is symbolic of his future Passion.<br><br>The painting takes its name from the “House of Litta,” a Milanese noble family in whose collection this painting was for much of the nineteenth century. In 1865 the Russian Tsar Alexander II acquired the panel for the Hermitage Museum, where it has been exhibited to this day. Upon obtaining the painting, the Hermitage had it transferred from wood to canvas.<br><br>The Madonna and Child was a common motif in Christian art during the Middle Ages and continued well into the Renaissance. The painting was regarded as Leonardo’s work because of the large number of copies made of it during the Renaissance period.<br></p>');
