In addition to major fresco cycles and altarpieces, he also painted touching images of the Madonna and Child for private devotion. This one dates to about 1480 and shows the Madonna and Child before a rose hedge—the Madonna was sometimes referred to as the &#34;rose without thorns&#34; (that is, without sin). The finely drawn hands and gray flesh tones are typical of Foppa’s work, as is the delicate modeling with gold.</p>');
