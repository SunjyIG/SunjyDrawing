document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />Lady Maria Conyngham </p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Sir Thomas Lawrence, ca. 1824–25. Lady Maria&#39;s father was created Marquess Conyngham in the peerage of Ireland in 1816. This was through the influence of his wife, Elizabeth, who in 1820 became the final mistress of the future King George IV of England. Husband and wife were in constant attendance at court. Between 1823 and 1826 the Marchioness and her three children sat for Sir Thomas Lawrence, the leading portraitist of the era. George IV was fond of Maria Conyngham and the present portrait hung for a time in his bedroom at one of the royal residences, St. James&#39;s Palace. The composition of the girl&#39;s portrait is elegant and the paint is applied to the canvas in broad, creamy strokes, with great assurance. However Lawrence was not greatly interested in drawing and her fingers are oddly jointed and disproportionately long. </p>');
