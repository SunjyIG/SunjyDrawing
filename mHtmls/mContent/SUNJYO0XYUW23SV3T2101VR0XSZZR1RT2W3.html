document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />The Trojan Women Setting Fire to Their Fleet</p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellee), ca. 1643. Claude Lorrain’s luminous skies and atmospheric effects are milestones in European painting. Like his contemporary Poussin, Claude viewed landscape through a classical lens: he represents the women of Troy setting fire to their ships in an effort to end years of wandering after their city was seized by the Greeks. Distant clouds and rain presage the storm sent by Jupiter at Aeneas’s request to quench the blaze. The subject must have particularly appealed to the man who commissioned it. Cardinal Girolamo Farnese was a prelate who returned to Rome in 1643, after years of itinerant service as papal nuncio combating Calvinism in remote Alpine cantons of the Swiss Confederation.</p>');
