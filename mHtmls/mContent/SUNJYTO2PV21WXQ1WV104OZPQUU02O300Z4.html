document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Edgar Degas, ca. 1900. Lithe and dynamic, racehorses and their brightly attired jockeys attracted Degas throughout his career. Here, he introduced a humorous note: the animal in the left foreground extends its neck to graze (which racehorses are trained not to do) or buck its rider, while the other men turn to watch. This pastel is the last of three variations of a composition made over a period of about twelve years. Degas added the horse and jockey at the right after the picture was largely completed, obscuring a fourth rider and his mount, just visible behind them.</p>');
