document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />The Japanese Bridge by Claude Monet depicts the footbridge over the lily pond at Monet’s Giverney Gardens. In 1883 Monet turned a small pond on at Giverney into an Asian-influenced water garden. Monet expanded his pond by diverting water from the Epte River. Monet surrounded the pond with a diverse arrangement of flowers,  bushes, and trees. He filled the basin with water lilies and added a Japanese-style wooden bridge in 1895. He then started painting the pond with its gardens, water lilies and Japanese Pond for the rest of his life.<br><br>During the period when these paintings were created, Claude Monet had serious cataract challenges with his eyes. In 1923, Monet underwent two operations to remove his cataracts. The pictures that were created while cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone, which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. It may also be that after surgery, he was able to see specific ultraviolet wavelengths of light that are usually excluded by the lens of the eye. His condition may have affected the colors he perceived because, after his operations, he repainted some of these paintings.<br></p>');
