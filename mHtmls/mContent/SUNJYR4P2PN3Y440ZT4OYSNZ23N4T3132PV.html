document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Claude Guy Halle, ca. 1681. Based on this oil sketch, approved by the Académie Royale in December 1681, Hallé executed a large-scale painting that served as his reception piece. The Académie’s approval of that work (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nancy) permitted Hallé to rise within the official academic ranks and show at the official exhibition space, the Salon. Students were assigned specific, often challenging, subjects for reception pieces. Louis XIV’s restoration of Catholicism in Strasbourg, dictated as a subject by the King’s official painter, Charles Le Brun, required Hallé to treat a contemporary event with the elevated language normally reserved for history or religious paintings. </p>');
