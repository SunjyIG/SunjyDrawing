document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Bailed Up” by Tom Roberts depicts a distinctive Australian subject of a stagecoach being held up by bushrangers in a forested section of an isolated road. Tom Roberts painted this work in 1895 while staying at a sheep station near a small town called Inverell in northern New South Wales, Australia. It was at this sheep station that he also painted “The Golden Fleece,” a famous painting depicting sheep shearing.<br><br>The notorious bushranger Captain Thunderbolt had been active near this sheep station at Inverell, more than twenty-five years before this painting had been made. Still, it would have influenced Roberts and helped him conceived the idea of painting this subject.<br><br>This painting presents the story of Captain Thunderbolt (Frederick Ward) holding up the Inverell–Glen Innes mail-coach. Roberts is beautifully depicting a crackling dry landscape in the heat and light of a high summer’s day in the Australian bush. It took 33 years for this iconic painting to find a buyer, and in 1927, Roberts reworked this painting to simplify the work making it more abstract.<br></p>');
