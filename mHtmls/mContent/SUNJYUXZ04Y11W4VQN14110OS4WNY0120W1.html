document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Mary Cassatt, 1893. “The Child’s Bath” was inspired by Japanese woodblocks and depicted a mother or female carer bathing of a child. The female figure holds up the child firmly and protectively while washing the child’s feet.<br><br>The left arm of the child braces against the mother’s thigh, while the other hand is holding on the child’s leg. The painting reflects the dignity of motherhood.<br><br>Cassatt was heavily influenced by her fellow Impressionist peers, especially Edgar Degas. In 1890, she was struck by the prints of the Japanese woodcuts.<br><br>Cassatt was drawn to the simplicity and clarity of the Japanese design, and the skillful use of blocks of color. Japanese prints and Degas inspired the perspective in this painting.</p>');
