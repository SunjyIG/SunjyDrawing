document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Dirck Hals, 1628. Frans Hals&#39;s younger brother Dirck probably studied with him and perhaps with the Rotterdam genre painter Willem Buytewech (1591/92–1624), who worked in Haarlem about 1612–17. Like Buytewech, Dirck was a specialist in depicting small figures, often with close attention to fashionable costume details. His colorful and painterly technique owed a great deal to his more gifted older brother, whose style and subjects are studied in the Museum&#39;s current exhibition, &#34;Frans Hals in the Metropolitan Museum&#34; (July 26–October 10, 2011). The present painting is generally abraded by cleaning in the past; wood grain is visible throughout the thinned paint layers, especially in the lighter passages.</p>');
