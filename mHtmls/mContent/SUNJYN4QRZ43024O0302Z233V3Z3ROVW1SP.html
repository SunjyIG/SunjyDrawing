The title of this painting is inscribed lower right beneath the signature.<br><br>In highly contrasting and vivid colors, the paint is applied thickly, with the perspective leading toward the door in the back.<br><br>Van Gogh stayed up for three consecutive nights to paint the picture, sleeping during the day. Van Gogh wrote to his brother about the Café:<br><br>“… staying open all night. “Night prowlers” can take refuge there when they have no money to pay for lodging or are too drunk to be taken in.”<br><br>Van Gogh depicted very few café scenes, but his most famous is “Cafe Terrace at Night,” showing outdoor tables, a street scene, and the night sky, which was also painted in Arles at about the same period in his life.</p>');
