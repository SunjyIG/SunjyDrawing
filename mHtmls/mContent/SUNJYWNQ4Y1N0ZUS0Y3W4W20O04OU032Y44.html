document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni” by Domenico Ghirlandaio portrays Giovanna degli Albizzi, a Florentine noblewoman. She died in childbirth, giving birth to her second child in 1488, and this painting was painted after her death.<br><br>Her husband, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, was deeply stricken by grief and commissioned this portrait of his wife to commemorate and honor her memory.<br><br>This panel is a powerful example of the late 1400’s Florentine portraiture. Giovanna has been identified as the subject of this portrait, thanks to her other named portraits, where she has the same hairstyle.<br><br>There is also a medallion showing her likeness and her name.  Giovanna is depicted in a traditional profile pose, which was favored due to its association with ancient coins and medallions.<br><br>The portrait followed the classical style of the period when the body proportions were idealized, and the faces conveyed character without expression.<br><br>Giovanna is shown wearing a richly embroidered dress and, in the background, is a selection of her personal belongings, a hanging coral rosary, and a prayers book.<br><br>The Latin inscription, taken from an epigram by the 1st century AD poet Martial and the Roman numerals represent the date of his death. The English translation is:<br><br>“Would that you Art, could portray her character and spirit; for then, there would be no fairer painting in the world.”<br></p>');
