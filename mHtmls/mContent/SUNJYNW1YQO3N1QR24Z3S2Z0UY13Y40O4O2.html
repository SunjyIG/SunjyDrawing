document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“The Horse Fair” by Rosa Bonheur depicts dealers selling horses at the horse market held on the tree-lined Boulevard de l’Hôpital, Paris. Bonheur used a series of sketches of draught horses, which she had made at the Paris horse market.<br><br>She attended the market twice weekly for a year and a half for her work. In addition to studies at the Paris horse market, she also modeled her animals on those from the Paris Omnibus Company, which were still horse-powered.<br><br>As a realist painter, she broke from tradition in depicting the horse eye as it is, and not using anthropomorphism for emotional effect.<br><br>In preparation for her research for this painting, Rosa Bonheur sought permission from the Paris police to dress as a man, to avoid drawing attention to herself.<br><br>She had earlier studied at a Paris slaughterhouse in 1845, a typical activity for an animal painter that she was the first woman to engage in, and had experienced harassment as a visible woman.<br><br>Bonheur routinely wore masculine clothes at home and in the country. She is quoted as saying:<br><br>“I am a painter. I have earned my living honestly. My private life is nobody’s concern.” <br><br>Among the influences on Bonheur’s work are sculptures from Ancient Greece. Bonheur described this painting as her own Parthenon Frieze.<br><br>This large-scale painting, with its realistic style extending eight feet tall by sixteen feet broad and energetic movement, is proto-cinematic in its effect.<br></p>');
