This portrait of an unidentified man, depicted in an interior with a landscape seen through the open window at the left, ultimately derives from a composition developed by early Netherlandish masters, namely Dieric Bouts in his 1462 Portrait of a Man (National Gallery, London). Dated 1491, it advances the formula by capturing the self-assured demeanor of the sitter, who directly addresses the viewer with a sidelong glance. The painting has been assigned to various regional German schools, but its closest analogy is found in the early portraits of Dürer, who was active in Nuremberg.</p>');
