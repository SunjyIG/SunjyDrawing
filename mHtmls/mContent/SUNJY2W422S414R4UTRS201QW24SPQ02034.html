Monet owned the property, which is now joined to the riverbank, and used it to moor his boats. He painted four versions of this composition, all signed and dated 1897. The setting and the misty, luminous atmosphere are similar to that of Morning on the Seine near Giverny (56.135.4), one of a series of views which Monet completed that year along the same stretch of water.</p>');
