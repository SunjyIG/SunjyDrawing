At age thirty-one, Manet’s sitter had emerged from a grim childhood and the unglamorous ranks of prostitution to become one of the most fashionable, wealthy, and famous courtesans in Paris. Enjoying a coterie of upper-crust suitors and a devoted following among the literati, she adeptly reinvented herself as the “Valtesse”—a play on “Your Highness” (“Votre Altesse”)—, adorning a luxurious home with portraits tracing her fictionalized noble lineage and a throne-like bed that in 1879-80 became the talk of the town as inspiration for the boudoir of Nana in Emile Zola’s best-selling novel. Manet’s demure and elegant image of the blue-eyed beauty, much to her delight, was shown for all of society to admire at the Salon of 1880, just a year after Henri Gervex turned heads with his polished, full-length portrait (Musée d’Orsay, Paris).</p>');
