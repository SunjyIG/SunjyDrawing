document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Nicola di Maestro Antonio d&#39;Ancona. This front of a chest (cassone) treats three episodes from the Bible relating to the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (ca. 605–562 BC). In one, the king has summoned wise men to interpret his dreams, which foretell his fall. In the second, he is driven from Babylon, and in the third he is shown, insane, eating grass &#34;like oxen,&#34; as one of his dreams had foretold. Especially beautiful is the gilded oak leaf decoration. Nicola di Maestro Antonio was one of the most eccentric painters of the Renaissance. This work dates about 1490.</p>');
