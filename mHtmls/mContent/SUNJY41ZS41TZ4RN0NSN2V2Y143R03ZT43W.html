document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Claude Monet, 1903–4. Between 1899 and 1901, Monet produced nearly a hundred views of the Thames River in London. He painted Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge from his room in the Savoy Hotel and the Houses of Parliament from Saint Thomas&#39;s Hospital across the river. The artist continued to refine the paintings until 1903, when he wrote to his dealer Durand-Ruel: &#34;I cannot send you a single canvas of London ... It is indispensable to have them all before me, and to tell the truth not one is definitely finished. I develop them all together.&#34; In 1904, this work and thirty-six others were shown at Durand-Ruel’s gallery in Paris. </p>');
