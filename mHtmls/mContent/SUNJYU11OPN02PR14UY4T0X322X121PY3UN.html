Her beauty made her an object of fascination for artists.<br><br>This painting was not commissioned but was at Sargent’s request. Sargent wrote to a friend:<br><br>“I have a great desire to paint her portrait and have reason to think she would allow it and is waiting for someone to propose this homage to her beauty.” <br><br>This painting resulted in a scandal following the painting’s controversial reception at the Paris Salon of 1884 as people were shocked and scandalized.<br><br>The attempt to preserve the subject’s anonymity by calling the picture “Portrait de Mme ***” was unsuccessful, and the sitter’s mother requested that Sargent withdraw the painting from the exhibition.<br><br>Sargent refused, but later, he overpainted the shoulder strap to raise it and make it look more securely fastened. Initially, as exhibited, the right strap on the dress was painted as having slipped off the shoulder.<br><br>He also changed the title to “Madame X,” a name more dramatic and mysterious and to give the illusion of the woman archetype.<br><br>John Singer Sargent is considered one of the leading portrait painters and is known for his evocations of the luxury of his era.<br><br>He created over 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as multiple sketches and drawings.
