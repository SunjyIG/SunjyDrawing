document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />Self-Portrait</p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Anthony van Dyck, ca. 1620–21. Lifting a languid hand to his chin, the young Van Dyck presents himself as an aristocrat, excluding any signs of his trade such as a palette and brushes. This self-portrait probably dates from the artist’s stay at the English court during the winter of 1620–21, an experience that left a lasting impact on his art and self-presentation. Shortly afterward, Van Dyck traveled to Italy, where his predilection for fine dress and aristocratic manners drew both the admiration and scorn of fellow artists.</p>');
