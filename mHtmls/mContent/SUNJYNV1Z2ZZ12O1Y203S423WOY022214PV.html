X-rays have revealed that the canvas initially featured a different face looking towards the viewer, which Fragonard painted over. <br><br>The figure represents femininity, and the Rococo color scheme conveys emotions and a mood. The darker background color frames and emphasizes the subject’s female profile.<br><br>The face of the young girls has a rosy-tint, which adds a delicate feel to the painting. The book has no clear writing, which contributes to a sense of mystery. Is she reading for pleasure or academic purposes?<br></p>');
