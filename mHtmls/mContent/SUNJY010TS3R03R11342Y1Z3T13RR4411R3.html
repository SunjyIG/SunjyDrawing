In 1899 Degas produced a series of compositions devoted to Russian dancers in which he fused color, line, and interlocking forms to create tapestry-like pictures. Degas called them his &#34;orgies of color.&#34; This figure was excerpted from a fully developed pastel of the same year (private collection), but the present work was almost certainly made by Degas as an independent drawing intended for ready sale. Another work from the series is in the Metropolitan’s Robert Lehman collection. </p>');
