He specialized in scenes of contemporary life referred to as bambocciate, after the nickname of the creator of the genre, Pieter van Laer. Although Miel&#39;s work stands in contrast to the premise of classical landscapes, he is known to have collaborated with Gaspard Dughet and it has been suggested that the landscape in this picture was painted by Dughet with the figures added by Miel.</p>');
