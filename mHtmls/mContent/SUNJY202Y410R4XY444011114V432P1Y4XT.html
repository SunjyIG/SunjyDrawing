document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“The Purple Noon’s Transparent Might” by Arthur Streeton depicts the blue and gold of Australia’s sun-drenched landscape. In early 1896 Streeton traveled to the upper reaches of the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, Australia. He was inspired by the expansive view looking towards the Blue Mountains. The title ‘The purple noon’s transparent might’ takes its name from a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley that embraces the natural world. Painted over two days during a hot summer, he contemplated Shelley’s poem.<br><br>On a ledge above the oaks and eucalypts, Streeton painted this work in two days, during a shade temperature of 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Later Streeton recalled he worked on the canvas in ‘a kind of artistic intoxication with thoughts of Shelley. Streeton wrote dramatically:<br><br>“My work may perish, but I must work so as to go on, …<br><br>When the painting was exhibited, it was immediately recognized as a masterpiece, and it received many tributes.<br><br>Shelley Poem<br><br>The sun is warm, the sky is clear, <br>The waves are dancing fast and bright, <br>Blue isles and snowy mountains wear <br>The purple noon’s transparent might, <br>The breath of the moist earth is light, <br>Around its unexpanded buds; <br>Like many a voice of one delight, <br>The winds, the birds, the ocean floods, <br>The City’s voice itself is soft like Solitude’s.<br><br>by Percy Bysshe Shelley<br><br>‘Stanzas Written in Dejection, Near Naples’ is considered one of Shelley’s most beautiful poems, It was published by Mrs. Shelley as “Posthumous Poems” in 1824, where it is dated as ‘December 1818’.  It is one of his representative Romantic poems, with its depiction of personal feeling against the backdrop of the natural world at the shores of the sea at the Bay of Naples.<br></p>');
