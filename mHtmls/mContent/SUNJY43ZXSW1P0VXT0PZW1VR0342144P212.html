This picture dates to the last years of Courbet’s life, from 1873 to 1877, which he spent as an expatriate in Switzerland. Like many landscapes that he produced at this time, it is a variation on the artist’s earlier depictions of the beloved terrain of his native France. In order to pay his debts and to meet the growing demand for his work, Courbet often turned to members of his studio for assistance with such canvases. The present painting has been associated with the hand of his student Marcel Ordinaire. </p>');
