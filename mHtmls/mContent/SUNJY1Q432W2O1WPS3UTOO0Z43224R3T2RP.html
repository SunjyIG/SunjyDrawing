document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Autumn” by Nicolas Poussin is also known as “The Spies with the Grapes of the Promised Land.” The painting depicts a scene in which long shadows are cast by the evening sun, whose fading light catches a town nestling under a mountain. The central figures of the composition are from the story in the Old Testament, Book of Numbers in which two Israelite spies return to their camp with the Grapes of the Promised Land. In Poussin’s interpretation, they need a pole to carry the large grapes, whose size is symbolic of the Promised Land. One of the spies also holds a branch of huge oranges.<br><br>This painting is one of four oil paintings by Nicolas Poussin, which together are called The Four Seasons. They are the last set of paintings to be completed by Poussin. The collection was painted in Rome between 1660 and 1664 for the nephew of Cardinal Richelieu. Each picture is a symbolic landscape with Old Testament figures conveying the different seasons and times of the day. Executed when the artist was in failing health suffering from a tremor in his hands, the Seasons are a philosophical reflection on the natural order of the world. Poussin chose to symbolize each season by a specific episode from the Old Testament. The iconography evokes not only the Christian themes of death and resurrection but also the pagan imagery of classical antiquity.<br><br>In this Autumn cycle, Poussin has painted a woman gathering fruit on a ladder leaning against the tree, with the ladder appearing to rise out of the grapes. This iconography can be interpreted as the Tree of Life, and the heavenly rewards promised in paradise after salvation.<br></p>');
