document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Giovanni Francesco Romanelli. Polyxena was the youngest daughter of Priam, King of Troy. According to a Greek tragedy by Euripides (ca. 480–406 B.C.), she was sacrificed on an altar over the grave of Achilles, whose death she had caused. Romanelli was a prominent painter in Rome and one of the most successful pupils of Pietro da Cortona. This painting is part of a series of classically inspired canvases depicting Ulysses, Cleopatra, Venus, and Polyxena. They were created for Lorenzo Chigi, Marquess of Montoro. The other pictures from the group are now in the Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, Virginia; the Cassa di Risparmio, Viterbo; and the Palazzo Patrizi, Rome. </p>');
