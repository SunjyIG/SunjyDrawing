document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Davide Ghirlandaio (David Bigordi). This imposing, well-preserved mural is an early work by Ghirlandaio, one of the most popular painters in late-fifteenth-century Florence and a master of the fresco technique. Its provenance is unknown, and the tradition that it decorated a chapel in the church of San Miniato fra le Torri in Florence is probably wrong: that fresco was described by early writers as about twice the size and was attributed to the Pollaiuolo brothers. <br><br>In true fresco technique, pigments mixed with water are applied directly on a fresh (or fresco) plaster wall. As the plaster sets, a chemical reaction occurs whereby the pigment particles become locked into the wall, giving the work great durability. In the fifteenth century, the design for a fresco was often executed with a red pigment, known as sinopia, on a preparatory layer of coarse plaster (&#34;arriccio&#34;). Over this was laid just the amount of finely ground plaster (&#34;intonaco&#34;) that could be painted in a single day. Our fresco comprises seven such sections, or &#34;giornate&#34;, which closely follow the contours of the figures and drapery. <br><br>The painting is in exceptionally good condition. Many details, especially in the landscape, were added after the plaster had dried. Such &#34;a secco&#34; details have usually fallen away.</p>');
