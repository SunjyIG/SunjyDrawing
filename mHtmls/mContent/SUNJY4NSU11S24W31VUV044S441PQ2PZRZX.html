After a study trip to France and North Africa, he settled in Paris from 1862 until 1870, when he returned to Frankfort. In Paris he exhibited Arab scenes that were admiringly compared to those of Delacroix and Fromentin. He did not date his paintings and often repeated motifs. A reversed image of the horseman in this work appears as the central figure of Arab Warrior (Milwaukee Art Center).</p>');
