document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Jacques Louis David, 1788. A landmark of European portraiture that asserts a modern, scientifically minded couple in fashionable but simple dress, this painting was nonetheless excluded from the Salon of 1789 for fears it would further ignite revolutionary zeal. Lavoisier was a pioneering chemist credited with the discovery of oxygen and the chemical composition of water through experiments in which his wife actively collaborated. However, he was also involved in studies of gunpowder and a misunderstanding about his removal of this precious commodity from the Bastille in the summer of 1789 threw his alliances into question. This mishap and his status as a tax collector (the more prosaic means by which he funded his scientific research) led him to be guillotined in 1794. Recent technical analysis has completely transformed our understanding of this portrait. In a first iteration, David had emphasized instead their status as wealthy tax collectors: the scientific instruments were not present at all, and Madame Lavoisier wore a gigantic, plumed hat, the height of fashion that would have given a very different tenor to what now appears to be a cerebral and restrained upper third of the portrait.</p>');
