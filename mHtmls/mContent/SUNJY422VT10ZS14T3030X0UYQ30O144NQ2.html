Peasants and popular life in rural settings were common subjects in seventeenth-century painting, though Michelin situates his figures—which include a baker and his cart, an old woman offering medicinal eau-de-vie, and a boy with a basket—in an urban context. Little is known about Michelin, whose subjects relate to the more famous brothers Le Nain, but this painting has served as a fixed point in defining his oeuvre since his signature and a date were discovered during a cleaning of this canvas in the late 1920s.</p>');
