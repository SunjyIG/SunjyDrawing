This cavalryman has been identified as a trumpeter in a regiment of French dragoons, a type of mounted soldier. De Neuville’s stock-in-trade were military paintings that emulate the sparkling style of Ernest Meissonier (whose work is displayed nearby). To create his scenes, De Neuville conducted careful research, and drew on his experiences as a naval cadet and as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. Long after that conflict ended, De Neuville capitalized on the intense patriotism and dreams of military glory that the French defeat aroused.</p>');
