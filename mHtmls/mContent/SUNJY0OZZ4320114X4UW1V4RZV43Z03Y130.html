Concurrently, he made this portrait of the magistrate&#39;s eldest son, Benedikt, who engages the viewer both with his direct glance and the inscription, which reads as if he is speaking: &#34;When I looked like this I was twenty-two years old.&#34; Following these words is the declaration that &#34;H.H.&#34; painted the work. The artist’s use of paper mounted on wood is unusual but not unique. He initiated the portrait as a drawing on paper and then continued working it up in oil colors to its completion.</p>');
