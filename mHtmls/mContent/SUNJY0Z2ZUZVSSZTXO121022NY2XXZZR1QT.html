His infatuation with her peak when she starred in the revival of Hervé’s “Chilpéric.”<br><br>Toulouse-Lautrec visited this operetta over twenty times, arriving just in time to see Lender dance the bolero in the second act. This painting shows Lender performing a bolero from the operetta.<br><br>Toulouse-Lautrec sketched and studied the actress producing six lithographs inspired by Lender’s appearance in Chilpéric and two paintings. However, his admiration was not reciprocated; she is said to have remarked.<br><br>“What a horrible man! <br> He is very fond of me …., but as for the portrait, you can have it!”<br><br>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was passionate about the Paris Theater, dance halls, and cabarets.

But he soon tired of his new partner, and one morning Galswintha was found strangled in her bed.
