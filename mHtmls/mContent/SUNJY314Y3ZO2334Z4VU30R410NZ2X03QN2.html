They rushed together into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia.…”<br><br>As a result of her reference in the Bible, Diana later became associated with many folk beliefs involving goddess-like supernatural figures that Catholic clergy demonize. In the Middle Ages, legends of night-time processions of spirits led by a female figure are recorded in the church records of Italy, Germany, and France.<br><br>Orazio Lomi Gentileschi (1563–1639) was an Italian painter.
