Given the social and political unrest in post-revolutionary Paris, Delacroix retreated to his country house at Champrosay in September 1848. There he undertook a series of flower paintings intended for the Salon of 1849, which he hoped would capture the variety and profusion of garden flowers. Because of the possibility of frost, he worked quickly, producing five canvases.
