In 1756, having won the Prix de Rome, Fragonard departed for four years at the French academy in that city, a traditional rite of artistic passage. Practically nothing is known of his journey from Paris, but on the return trip he traveled by way of Florence to Venice, west to Marseilles, and north through Lyons. He visited the principal cities of Italy again in 1774, as well as Vienna and Frankfurt. This painting is most likely an imagined conglomeration of the kinds of gardens, architecture, and sculpture he encountered. </p>');
