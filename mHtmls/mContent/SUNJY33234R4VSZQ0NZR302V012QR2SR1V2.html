document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, ca. 1824–26. Preparing to undertake his first major painting, The Hunting of Chevy Chase (City Museums and Art Gallery, Birmingham), the young Landseer made a pilgrimage to sketch Rubens&#39;s Wolf and Fox Hunt (Metropolitan Museum), a picture that had recently been acquired by Alexander Baring, later Lord Ashburton. Not only the subject but also the bravura brushwork and sparkling, transparent lighting effects reveal Landseer&#39;s fascination with Rubens&#39;s art. Hunting scenes never went out of fashion in the country houses of Britain, and Landseer quickly became the acknowledged modern master of the genre.</p>');
