This is one of a group of six pictures that Sickert painted of two Belgians, Jeanne and Hélène Daurmont, during the Easter holiday in 1906. Jeanne, a milliner, later recalled that she and her sister, a charwoman, had met the artist in London when he overheard them speaking to a policeman in French. The subdued palette, softly smudged outlines, and direct approach to the model anticipate the artist&#39;s later Camden Town style, for which he is best known.<br><br>At Easter time 1906 Sickert sent his friend Mrs. George Swinton several postcards with sketches of paintings he was working on. One of them depicts this picture and is inscribed: Easter Monday No.1. Jeanne (private collection).</p>');
