Shortly after Courbet exhibited a group of snowy landscapes in 1867, several younger artists, among them Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, explored the possibilities of landscapes executed in white or gray with just a few touches of bright color. Sisley, like Monet, continued to paint snow scenes for the rest of his life. This work, with its nuanced palette and expertly rendered brushstrokes, is one of several that Sisley made in winter 1891 at Moret, south of Paris. It depicts the rue Eugène Moussoir, bordered by the wall of the village hospital, just minutes from Sisley’s home.</p>');
