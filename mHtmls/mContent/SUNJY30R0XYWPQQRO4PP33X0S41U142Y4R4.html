document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Jean-Baptiste Joseph Pater, ca. 1725. Pater painted subjects pioneered by his teacher, Watteau, including the fête galante and the military troops that both artists favored early in their careers. Pater’s reception piece to the Académie Royale in 1728 was The Soldiers’ Merrymaking. Like Watteau, Pater probably knew such subjects firsthand in the wake of Louis XIV’s waning military success. Rather than depict triumphant or heroic combat, in the manner of battle painters, Pater focused on the improvised camps where soldiers slept, smoked, drank, and ate in the company of women.</p>');
