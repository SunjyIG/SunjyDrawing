A year later he married a socially prominent eighteen-year-old beauty, Ernestine Aloisia Ungnad von Weissenwolff. As director of the imperial theaters from 1754 until 1764, Durazzo promoted Gluck&#39;s reform of Italian opera.

In 1717 he moved to Paris and worked there as a portrait-miniaturist. He travelled widely in Germany, Italy, and Austria, before accepting in 1731 the position of official painter at the imperial court at Vienna.</p>');
