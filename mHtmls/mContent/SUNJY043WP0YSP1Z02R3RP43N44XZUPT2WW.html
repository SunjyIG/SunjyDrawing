Ridolfo was the son of Domenico Ghirlandaio, and like his father headed a workshop that was prepared to undertake a variety of tasks, from the decoration of a chapel to small portable altarpieces. The destination of this work is not known, but the presence of Saint Benedict in one of the wings and of a kneeling Benedictine in the foreground of the center panel suggests that it was made for a Benedictine monastery. It is contemporary with the frescoes in the Cappella dei Priori of 1514 and, in its landscape setting and the figure types, depends on Fra Bartolomeo and Mariotto Albertinelli.</p>');
