She was the constant companion of a wealthy and dissolute young Irishman, Thomas, or Buck, Whaley, by whom she had four children: Thomas, Richard, Ann, and Sophia Isabella. They lived in a house Buck Whaley built on the Isle of Man, where this portrait may have hung in the dining room. The coloring is sober and autumnal and the figure quite withdrawn. The black dress figured with leaves would have been thought elegant and modern. This portrait may have been painted about 1795.</p>');
