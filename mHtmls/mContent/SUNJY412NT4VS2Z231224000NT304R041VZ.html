document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Theodore Gericault, ca. 1819–20. The subject of this portrait is the nephew of Gericault’s friend the painter Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy. This canvas is one of a small group of drawings and paintings (in various collections) that depict the eight- or nine-year-old Alfred and his younger sister, Elisabeth, with remarkable self-possession and grace for their age. Alfred became a painter and, like Gericault, was enamored of horses. Eugène Delacroix, who had studied with Gericault, later owned this painting. </p>');
