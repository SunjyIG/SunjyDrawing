document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Michiel Sweerts, ca. 1661. Clothing the naked is one of the Seven Acts of Mercy traditionally promoted in Catholicism. Sweerts, a Catholic artist from the Spanish Netherlands, reduces the theme to a fraught confrontation between two individuals, one opulently dressed, the other nude and seemingly wary of the garments offered to him. He painted this image, most likely for a Catholic patron, while living in Amsterdam and engaged in regular fasting and other acts of devotion. In 1662 the artist joined a group of missionaries bound for Persia, although he was later dismissed from their company for his erratic behavior.</p>');
