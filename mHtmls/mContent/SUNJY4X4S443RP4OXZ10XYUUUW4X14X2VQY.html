document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />Portrait of Lady Agnew of Lochnaw by John Singer Sargent depicts Gertrude Agnew, the wife of Sir Andrew Agnew, 9th Baronet. Lady Agnew is seated in an 18th-century French chair with a back that is curving to create a space for a distinctive elegance. She is shown in a three-quarter length pose, dressed in a white gown with a silk mauve sash around her waist. The wall behind her is draped with Chinese silk of a blue color. Lady Agnew looks directly at the viewer. Her intimate expression is both challenging and quizzical half-smiling.<br><br>Gertrude Vernon was born in 1865, the granddaughter of the 1st Baron Lyveden. She married Sir Andrew Agnew, 9th Baronet of Lochnaw Castle, in 1889. A few years later, he commissioned John Singer Sargent to paint her portrait. The public success of the painting endowed her with additional prestige. Lady Agnew died in London in1932 after suffering ill health for a long time.<br></p>');
