document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)” by Winslow Homer is an iconic painting of a father and three boys out for a spirited sail. Homer had a sensibility that allowed him to distill art from potentially sentimental subjects and to create straightforward views of the American life of the period. Homer painted warm and appealing images that appealed to the postwar nostalgia for a simpler, more innocent America. Following a trip to Europe in 1866–1867, Homer adopted a warmer palette and a technique, which owed much to the influence of French artists such as Courbet, Manet, and Monet.<br><br>Winslow Homer was best known for his marine subjects and is considered one of the foremost painters in 19th-century America. Mostly self-taught, Homer began his career working as a commercial illustrator. He subsequently took up oil painting and produced significant studio works. He also worked extensively in watercolor, creating a rich legacy, primarily chronicling his working vacations.<br></p>');
