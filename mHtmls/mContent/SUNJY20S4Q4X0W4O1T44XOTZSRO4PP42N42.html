document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />Saint Margaret of Cortona</p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Gaspare Traversi, ca. 1758. Traversi is known primarily for his lively, sometimes bawdy genre scenes, but here he lends quiet grace to representing Margaret of Cortona, a thirteenth-century nun canonized during the artist’s lifetime, in 1728. She is shown wearing the habit of a Franciscan Tertiary, holding a crucifix, and gazing into the face of an angel who has appeared to her holding a crown of thorns. In the background, Satan, who had attempted to persuade her to return to her former sinful life, withdraws into the fire of hell. A rustic, contemporary interior and the exchange between her illegitimate son (a sign of her former sins) and the dog (her attribute) naturalize an otherworldly religious scene.</p>');
