Wheelwright recalled that Millet took the second version to the same state of completion as the original, and then &#34;worked on the two pictures alternatively,&#34; advancing on one, then turning to the other, and &#34;in this way making both . . . better than either would have been without the rivalry.&#34; Wheelwright selected the one now in Cincinnati.</p>');
