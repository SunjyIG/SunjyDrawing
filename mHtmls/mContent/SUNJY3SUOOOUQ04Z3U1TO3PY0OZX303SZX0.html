document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Endormies” by Rupert Bunny depicts two female figures relaxing and dreaming at the water’s edge.

Bunny modeled the sleeping figure on his wife Jeanne Morel, who featured in many paintings during this period.<br><br>Jeanne is a French variation of Jean, and the meaning of the name is “God is gracious.” Her graceful and sensuous features graced many of his paintings.<br><br>In this painting, Bunny has included a rose, a traditional symbol of love, as well as the white swans, which are symbolic of grace and beauty. These are recurring themes in Bunny’s compositions and was inspired by French art motifs from before the Great War. Many artists also used the motif of a small dog to symbolize marital fidelity, which can be seen in this painting, sleeping at the feet of his mistress.<br></p>');
