Space and lighting communicate the energetic rhythms of the dance, its sound, and movement. <br><br>The painting is an example of John Singer Sargent’s Impressionism, and an example of Hispanism, the phenomenon of fascination with Spanish culture in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.<br><br>Sargent made Aatrip through Spain, and North Africa in 1879 inspired the painting. The painting is related to a series of works Sargent painted during a subsequent stay in Venice.<br><br>The painting was preceded by a series of preliminary studies, focusing mainly on the dancer’s stylized posture.<br><br>In 1914,  El Jaleo was exhibited at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in a uniquely constructed Spanish Cloister gallery framed by a Moorish arch.<br><br>Sargent was so impressed he also presented Isabella Stewart Gardner with an album of drawings he had made as preparatory sketches for the work.<br><br>Flamenco<br><br>Flamenco is an art form based on the various folkloric music traditions of Andalusia in southern Spain.
