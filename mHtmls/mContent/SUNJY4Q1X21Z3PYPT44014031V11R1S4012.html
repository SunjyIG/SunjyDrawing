Unlike Jan Brueghel the Elder, who was a leading figure in the development of realistic landscape painting, Kerstiaen de Keuninck continued the Flemish tradition of imaginary mountain scenery that descended from Patinir. This large panoramic landscape view, dominated by fantastic mountains and rock formations, is an early work of the artist and was probably painted in Antwerp. It employs contrasting pictorial effects—such as heavy passages of opaque paint set off against areas sketched in a very thin medium—and bold motifs like the water spray formed by flicking the brush to suggest the sublime effects of Nature.</p>');
