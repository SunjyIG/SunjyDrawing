Pater was the only official student of Antoine Watteau (1684–1721), who pioneered subjects of overgrown gardens populated by well-dressed men and women engaged in amorous pursuits. In this exceptionally well-preserved painting, Pater uses Watteau’s painting technique, figural poses, and overall mood, but gives the subject a twist by depicting children at play: note the hobbyhorse and pinwheel. Ange Laurent de La Live de Jully (1725–1779), one of the most important eighteenth-century collectors of contemporary French art, once owned this painting and valued it highly enough to make his own etching after it.</p>');
