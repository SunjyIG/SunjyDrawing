document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />Portrait of a Woman with a Man at a Casement </p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Fra Filippo Lippi, ca. 1440. This is the earliest surviving double portrait in Italy, the first to show the sitters in a domestic setting, and the first with a view onto a landscape. The woman, dressed luxuriously ala francese, her sleeve embroidered with letters spelling &#34;lealta&#34; (faithful), is observed by a man—her betrothed?—appearing at a window, his hands on an identifying coat of arms. The two figures may be Lorenzo di Ranieri Scolari and Angiola di Bernardo Sapiti, who were married about 1439. Lippi’s task was complicated by the Italian preference for the profile view as opposed to the three-quarter view preferred north of the Alps.</p>');
