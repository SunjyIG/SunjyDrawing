document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />Blind Orion Searching for the Rising Sun</p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Nicolas Poussin, 1658. Classical myth provided Poussin with a pretext for one of his greatest landscapes, executed with the staid, nearly pointallist precision that the artist adopted late in life. According to the Greek writer Lucian (A.D. 125–180), the blind giant Orion was directed towards the healing rays of the sun by Cedalion, seen here standing on his shoulders. Poussin includes a meteorological subtext of the circulation of the elements by representing the Earth’s vapors rising towards the moon (where Diana stands watching) that will return as rain. Poussin executed this poetic painting for Michel Passart, an important Parisian patron of landscapes by Poussin and Claude Lorrain.</p>');
