document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Gaspare Diziani. This painting crowns the sumptuous, immersive interior of a bedroom that was once part of the Segredo family’s palace, which still stands along Venice’s Grand Canal. Many parts of the palace were dismantled and sold in the early twentieth century, when this room entered The Met’s collection. Stuccoists Abbondio Stazio (1633–1745) and Carpoforo Mazzetti Tencalla (1685–1743) probably completed the three-dimensional frame in the 1720s, though Diziani may not have supplied his painting until the 1750s. His allegorical depiction of Dawn was perfectly suited to the room’s function, and her attendant putti echoed the stucco figures that seem to hold the canvas aloft. </p>');
