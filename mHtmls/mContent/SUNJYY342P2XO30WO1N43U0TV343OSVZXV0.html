Although Lautrec is best known for his depictions of the bawdy entertainments on offer in Paris’s Montmartre neighborhood, he was also intrigued by the lively world of the racetrack. In the late 1890s he painted a group of scenes that capture spectators and riders in off-hand moments. Here, he created a witty visual parallel between the exaggerated, bustled silhouette of the woman in the foreground, and the horse and rider behind her. At lower left, Lautrec inscribed the painting “to Émilie”; her identity remains unknown. </p>');
