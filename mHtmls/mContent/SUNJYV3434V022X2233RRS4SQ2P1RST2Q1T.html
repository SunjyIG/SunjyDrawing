document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Jean-Francois Millet, 1872–73. Millet wrote to his patron Frédéric Hartmann on February 18, 1873 that he had nearly completed this picture for the dealer Durand-Ruel: &#34;It is a hillock, with a single tree almost bare of leaves, and which I have tried to place rather far back in the picture. The figures are a woman seen from behind and a few turkeys. I have also tried to indicate the village in the background on a lower plane.&#34; The setting is near Barbizon, where Millet lived from 1849 until his death. The tower of the neighboring hamlet of Chailly-en-Bière is visible in the distance.</p>');
