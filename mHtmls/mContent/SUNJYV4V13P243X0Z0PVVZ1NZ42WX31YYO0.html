document.write('<p class="mFontSizeBColor" />Saint Peter Martyr Healing the Leg of a Young Man</p>');
document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Antonio Vivarini,  ca. 1450. This painting belongs to a series of eight scenes that would have been arranged around an image or statue of Saint Peter Martyr (1205–1252). Here the saint ministers to a youth who had kicked his mother and cut off his leg in remorse. A genial storyteller, Antonio sets the scene in a carpenter’s shop. Together with his younger brother Bartolomeo, his partner Giovanni d’Allemagna (who died in 1450), and his son Alvise, Antonio established a family enterprise in Venice surpassed in prestige only by that of Jacopo Bellini and his sons. </p>');
