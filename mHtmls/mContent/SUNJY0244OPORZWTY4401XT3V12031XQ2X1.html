document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Arnolfini Portrait” by Jan van Eyck is a full-length double portrait, depicting the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, in their home in the Flemish city of Bruges.<br><br>Arnolfini was a member of a merchant family from Lucca living in Bruges, as an agent of the Medici family. The couple is depicted in their prosperous home.<br><br>This masterpiece is considered one of the most original and sophisticated paintings in our heritage of early oil paintings.<br><br>This painting is famous for its elaborate symbolism, detailed rendering, geometric perspective, use of light, and for the various detailed elements in the picture, such as the mirror, to create a realistic space.<br><br>The vibrant colors highlight the material wealth and opulence of the subject’s world. Van Eyck’s quest for realism means he probably employed a magnifying glass to paint the minute details such as the highlights inf the amber beads hanging beside the mirror and the smaller pictures within the mirror’s surround.<br><br>The painting is full of everyday details and symbolism. Van Eyck has injected symbolism throughout the picture, such as the little dog, which symbolizes fidelity. And the bedpost’s crowning ornament is a small statue of Saint Margaret, who is the patron saint of childbirth.<br><br>The ornate Latin signature under the mirror translates as ‘Jan van Eyck was here 1434’. Jan van Eyck was a Flemish painter active in Bruges. He is one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art.<br><br>The “Arnolfini Portrait” and his “Ghent Altarpiece” are the oldest panel masterpieces that were executed in oils and not in tempera.<br><br>Van Eyck took advantage of the longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colors as wet paint to achieve variations in light and shade to create the illusion of three-dimensional depictions.<br></p>');
