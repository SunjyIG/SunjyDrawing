document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Nicolas Poussin, probably 1633–34. According to Roman mythology, the neighboring Sabines were invited to a festival with the intention of forcibly retaining their young women as wives. When the Roman leader Romulus raised his cloak, his warriors seized the women. This dramatic story gave Poussin the opportunity to display his command of gesture and pose and his knowledge of ancient sculpture and architecture. The man at the right wears a yellow lorica made of leather. The painting belonged to the maréchal de Créquy, who was the French ambassador to Rome from June 1633 to July 1634, and then to Cardinal Richelieu.</p>');
