Van Gogh wrote to his brother:<br><br>“I am working at it every morning from sunrise on,<br> for the flowers fade so quickly.<br> I am now in the fourth picture of sunflowers.<br> This fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers … it gives a singular effect.”<br><br>This painting was created during a period of optimism when Van Gogh awaited the arrival of his hero, the avant-garde painter Paul Gauguin.<br><br>The lonely painter dreamed of establishing an artist community with Gauguin as its mentor.</p>');
