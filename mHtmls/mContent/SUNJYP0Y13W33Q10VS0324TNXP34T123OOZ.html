document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Giacomo Ceruti, 1740s. Ceruti was nicknamed “Pitocchetto” (the little beggar) in response to his success painting characters from the lower classes such as this woman, most likely a maidservant carrying her mistress’s dog. Direct and unidealized in its presentation, the painting balances a certain humor about the spoiled animal and the woman’s unflattering show of teeth with a surprising dignity lent by her direct stare and confidently outstretched hand. Ceruti remains an enigmatic personality, but his works were avidly collected by amateurs throughout northern Italy.</p>');
