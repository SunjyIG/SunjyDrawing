document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Francois Hubert Drouais, 1767. Disguised portraiture was frequently used by fashionable portraitists like Drouais and allowed sitters to convey added layers of information through reference to myth and ancient history. “Vestal Virgin” comes from a category of women in ancient Rome who devoted themselves to Vesta, goddess of the hearth (alluded to here in the brazier on which offerings might be made). This guise was well-suited to women who were unmarried or about to marry. This unknown sitter’s gold-trimmed robe is not contemporary dress but a historicizing costume; her pose, unveiling herself, is typical of the simultaneously chaste and alluring nature of this particular disguise.</p>');
