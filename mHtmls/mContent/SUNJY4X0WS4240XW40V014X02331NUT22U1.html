document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Davide Ghirlandaio (David Bigordi), ca. 1488. This dynastic portrait shows the Florentine banker Francesco Sassetti and his young son Teodoro, born in 1479. Teodoro was named after his elder brother, who died that same year. Sassetti managed the Medici banks in Avignon, Geneva, and Lyons and was an advisor to Piero de&#39; Medici and Lorenzo the Magnificent. The combination of full face and profile gives the picture a decidedly formal quality, in keeping with its function as a commemoration of a loss and regeneration. The background shows an oratory built by Sassetti in Geneva. The head and figure of Sassetti are much repainted.</p>');
