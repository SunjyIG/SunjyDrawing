document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Camille Corot, ca. 1871–74. Ville-d’Avray, a town on the outskirts of Paris where Corot’s family had owned a house and property since 1817, was among the artist&#39;s favorite motifs. This work is one of several paintings of the property&#39;s pond seen through a delicate screen of trees that he made in his later years. The silvery, cool tonality may have been influenced by Corot’s study of the contemporary medium of photography. The blurred appearance of the trees in the foreground, for example, is similar to the effect of foliage in motion as captured in nineteenth-century photographs.</p>');
