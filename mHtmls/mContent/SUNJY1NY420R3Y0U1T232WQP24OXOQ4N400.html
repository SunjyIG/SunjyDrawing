This canvas of summer 1895 shows a corner of Pissarro&#39;s garden at Éragny, a small village in northern France where he lived from 1884 until his death. Pissarro likely painted this view from his studio window, as a persistent eye ailment hampered him from working outdoors. The picture was among the works that Pissarro sold in November to the dealer Durand-Ruel, who included it in a major exhibition of the artist’s work the following spring. </p>');
