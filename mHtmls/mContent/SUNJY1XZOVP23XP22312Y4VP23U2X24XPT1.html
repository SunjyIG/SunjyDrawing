He specialized in views of sea and sky and coastal subjects, and was known for detailed, accurate depictions of the natural world such as this one. Kynance Cove lies north and west of Lizard Head, the furthest southwest point in Cornwall. Brett, a yachtsman, doubtless reached Kynance by sea, as in the 1870s and 1880s he spent his summers sailing the coast.</p>');
