Captivated by the &#34;unique light,&#34; he embarked on a painting campaign featuring four different areas of the cityscape. He began each day with views such as this one, showing the airy façade of the Doge’s Palace from across the water on the islet of San Giorgio Maggiore. Monet departed Venice reluctantly, writing &#34;It&#39;s so beautiful … I console myself with the thought of returning next year, for I was only able to make attempts, beginnings.&#34; Although he never returned, Monet continued working on his canvases. The present picture and twenty-eight others were exhibited to acclaim in Paris in the spring of 1912. </p>');
