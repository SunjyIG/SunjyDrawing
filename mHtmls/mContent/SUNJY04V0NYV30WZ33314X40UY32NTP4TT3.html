document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott” by John William Waterhouse is the third painting by Waterhouse that depicts a scene from the Tennyson 1832 poem, “The Lady of Shalott.”<br><br>The scene shows the plight of a young woman from Arthurian legend, who yearned for the outside world but was isolated under a curse in a tower near King Arthur’s Camelot.<br><br>The lady wears a red dress, in a small dark room with Romanesque column windows. The Lady of Shalott was forbidden to look directly at the outside world.<br><br>She was doomed to view the world through a mirror and weave what she saw into a tapestry. In this painting, Waterhouse shows the large round mirror, through which the Lady views the world.<br><br>He also captures her yearning look as she sees a couple in the bottom right of the mirror.<br><br>The frame of the loom and the geometric tiles of the floor contrast with the vivid colors of nature outside.<br><br>The title of the painting is a quotation from the last two lines in the final verse of the second part of Tennyson’s poem:<br><br>“But in her web, she still delights<br>To weave the mirror’s magic sights,<br>For often thro’ the silent nights<br>A funeral, with plumes and lights<br>And music came from Camelot:<br>Or when the moon was overhead<br>Came two young lovers lately wed;<br>‘I am half sick of shadows,’ said<br>The Lady of Shalott.”<br><br>This painting depicts an earlier point in the tale than that represented by the previous two works by Waterhouse. In this painting, the mirror reveals a bridge over a river leading to the walls and towers of Camelot.<br><br>The scene is set shortly before an image of Lancelot appears in the mirror. Lancelot enticed the Lady out of her tower to her death.<br></p>');
