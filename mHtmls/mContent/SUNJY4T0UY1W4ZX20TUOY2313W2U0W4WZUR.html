document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Theodore Rousseau, ca. 1860–65. Approximately three miles separate the village of Barbizon, where Rousseau settled in 1836, and this site at the edge of the forest of Fontainebleau. Romantic artists had long been attracted by Arbonne’s rocky outcroppings, boulders, and strange, twisted trees. This painting, with its heightened color, strong contrasts of hue, and varied textures, is characteristic of forest sunsets painted during the final decade of Rousseau’s career. Throughout the composition the wood panel shows through the paint layer, its warm brown surface serving as a midtone. </p>');
