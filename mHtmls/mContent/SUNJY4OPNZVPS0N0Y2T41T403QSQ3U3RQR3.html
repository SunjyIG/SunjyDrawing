document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1883. During his trip in late summer 1883 to the English Channel island of Guernsey, Renoir painted about fifteen views of the bay and the beach of Moulin Huet, on the island&#39;s rocky southern coast. This picturesque view of the bay, seen from a vantage point favored by contemporary guidebooks, is related to three other works distinguished by their finish and by the fact that the artist signed and dated them. No doubt it was among the four Guernsey landscapes the artist sold to Durand-Ruel in the fall.</p>');
