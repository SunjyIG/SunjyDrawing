The gas is yellow, and the reflections are russet gold descending to green-bronze.<br> On the aquamarine field of the sky, the Great Bear is a sparkling green and pink,<br> whose discreet paleness contrasts with the brutal gold of the gas.”<br><br>The blue colors dominate, and the city gas lights glimmer with an intense orange that is reflected in the water, and the stars sparkle like gemstones.</p>');
