Unfortunately, after this success, his career that ended tragically a year later when Manet died.<br><br>The picture exhibits Manet’s full range of brushwork, from the delicate floral touches on the dress to the subtlety of Jeanne’s face and the sketch-like strokes of the background.<br><br>Much later, this painting became the first work of art ever to be published in color.<br><br>The French actress wears camel-colored gloves, a floral dress with a ruffled bonnet tied around the neck with a black bow, and a lace parasol.<br><br>Manet, himself organized the ensemble by exploring dressmakers’ and milliners’ shops. It is sad that Manet died at 51 years old and did not complete the series.<br></p>');
