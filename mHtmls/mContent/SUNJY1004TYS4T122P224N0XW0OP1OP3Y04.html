document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Desdemona” by Frederic Leighton depicts the Venetian beauty from William Shakespeare’s play Othello which was written in 1601 – 1604.<br><br>Desdemona’s story starts when she enrages her father, a Venetian senator, when she elopes with Othello. Othello is a brave soldier of Moorish background in the service of the Venetian Republic, but several years her senior.<br><br>When Othello is deployed to Cyprus in the service of the Republic of Venice, Desdemona accompanies him. His ensign then manipulates her husband into believing she is an adulteress.<br><br>Othello has its source in a 1565 Italian tale, which may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508.<br><br>The only named character in the original story is “Disdemona.” The name derives from Greek, which means “ill-fated, unfortunate.”<br><br>In the original tale, the ensign lusts after Disdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. <br><br>While Shakespeare followed the original tale’s influence in composing Othello, he deviated significantly in many details. <br><br>In Shakespeare’s play, Desdemona is deeply upset by her husband’s attacks but continues to assert her love.<br><br>In the final act, Othello tells her that he knows she has been unfaithful and is going to kill her.<br><br>Despite Desdemona’s claims of innocence, Othello refuses to believe her. Othello strangles Desdemona in his paranoia.<br><br>Eventually, Othello learns of Desdemona’s faithfulness after all the lies have been exposed, and he commits suicide.<br><br>The role of Desdemona has attracted many notable actresses through the centuries, and Margaret Hughes (1645 – 1719), the first professional actress on the English stage, has the distinction of being the first to perform the role in 1660.<br></p>');
