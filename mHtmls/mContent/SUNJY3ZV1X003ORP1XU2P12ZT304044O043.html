The legendary Queen Dido is regarded as the founder of the city.<br><br>According to legend, Dido purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide. She then cunningly cut the oxhide into long thin strips, she then laid out her claim with the long strips and founded an empire.<br><br>As Carthage became a superpower, the Ancient Greek city-state contested with Carthage for the Western Mediterranean culminating in the Sicilian Wars and the Pyrrhic War over Sicily.<br><br>The Carthaginian Republic was one of the longest-lived and most significant states in the ancient Mediterranean.

The Romans fought three wars against Carthage, known as the Punic Wars.<br><br>“Punic” meaning “Phoenician” in Latin, as Carthage was a Phoenician colony that had grown into an independent kingdom. The Roman Republic destroyed the ancient city in the Third Punic War in 146 BC and later re-developed as Roman Carthage.<br><br>The Fall of Carthage<br><br>Despite initial devastating Rome with naval losses, Rome’s recovery from the brink of defeat.
