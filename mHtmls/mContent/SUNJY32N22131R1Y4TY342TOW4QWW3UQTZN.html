document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />“Flight and Pursuit” by William Rimmer is set in a mysterious Near Eastern palace depicting a man racing toward a significant set of steps. The man has a red beard and mustache with a large earring. He is dressed simply in a green cloak over his white tunic and a short blade in his thin belt.<br><br>Behind the runner are shadows of other people, perhaps following the runner in pursuit. In a parallel hallway, a ghostly third man in white who is holding a sword. He is running alongside and glances toward the central figure.<br><br>Which of the men is fleeing and which is in pursuit is left to the viewer’s imagination. However, a separate draft drawing of the central figure has an inscribed with the words:<br><br>“Oh, for the Horns of the Altar.” <br><br>This phrase is from the Old Testament. It implies that one of the figures is rushing toward an altar of sanctuary. Accused criminals were untouchable while they remained within the sacred space of an altar of sanctuary.<br><br>Rimmer drew many of his artistic subjects from the Bible and ancient history. The works of the poet and painter William Blake, whose books and watercolors were collected in Boston during this period, may have been an inspiration for this theme.<br><br>This enigmatic painting has been interpreted as a man fleeing his conscience.
