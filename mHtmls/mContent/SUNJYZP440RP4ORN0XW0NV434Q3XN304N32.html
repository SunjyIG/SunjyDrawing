Marie Rinteau is best remembered today as the great-grandmother of the writer George Sand (1840–1876), though she and and her sister Geneviève enjoyed a brief moment of success on the French stage (note the sheet music she holds) and long careers as cultured courtesans, known as “les demoiselles de Verrières.” The modish portraitist Drouais exhibited this painting showing Rinteau at her dressing table in the Salon of 1761. Originally, however, Rinteau’s hair did not rise to such beribboned heights: in the mid-1770s, Drouais or another painter altered Rinteau’s wig in order to keep up with the latest fashion.</p>');
