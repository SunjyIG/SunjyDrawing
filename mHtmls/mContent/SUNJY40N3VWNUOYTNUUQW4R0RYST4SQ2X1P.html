document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By William Hogarth, 1729. This depiction of a wedding is one of the artist&#39;s first essays in the fashionable genre of the conversation piece, a type of group portrait. Beckingham, a London lawyer, and his bride are flanked by members of their families. The setting is based on the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square, not the actual church where the wedding took place. Although Hogarth was sought after for his ability to capture a likeness, the solemn event depicted here seems to have had limited appeal to him compared with the satire of his famous “modern moral subjects.”</p>');
