This picture, with the artist&#39;s characteristic rugged figures, is an evocative visualization of the foundation of Rome as described in Virgil’s Aeneid (1st c. B.C.). While Aeneas sleeps on the banks of the river Tiber, &#34;there appeared to him the God of the place, old Tiber himself, who arose from his pleasant stream amid poplar leaves. A fine linen clothed him in gray raiment, and shady reeds covered his hair. Then he spoke to Aeneas, and assuaged all his care with his words . . . . ‘This spot shall be the place for your city.’&#34; </p>');
