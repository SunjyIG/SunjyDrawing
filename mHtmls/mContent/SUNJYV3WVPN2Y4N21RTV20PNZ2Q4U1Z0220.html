Two years later the painting was delivered to Wolfe’s Madison Avenue brownstone, where it hung in the library, along with her three-quarter-length portrait by Cabanel. In October 1885, soon before she died, Wolfe moved Roman Girl at a Fountain, said to be one of her favorite works, to a specially constructed niche in her dining room.</p>');
