A pupil of Paolo Panini in Rome, Joli was active as a scene painter in northern Italy and especially in Venice (1732–42), where he was influenced by the work of Canaletto. From 1744 until 1748 he worked in London at the King&#39;s Theatre in the Haymarket and also produced topographical paintings. The present picture combines the two genres; the imaginary foreground is inspired by antiquity, while in the background is a view of the north bank of the Thames with St. Paul&#39;s cathedral, the Tower of London, and Old London Bridge. </p>');
