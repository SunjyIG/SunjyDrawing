document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Charles-Francois Daubigny, ca. 1852. This peaceful evening scene is thought to be based on drawings Daubigny made in 1852 at Optevoz, a town in the valley of the river Rhône that he had first visited in 1849. (One of these sketches is also in the Museum&#39;s collection.) Although the painting appears to give a straightforward description of things seen, Daubigny is thought to have sacrificed finish and detail in order to imbue its modest subject with a poetic effect. Another version of the composition, signed and dated 1857 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), shows the view in different light and from a slightly greater distance.</p>');
