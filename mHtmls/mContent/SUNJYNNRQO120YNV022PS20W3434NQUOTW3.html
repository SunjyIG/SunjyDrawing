Each participant had to drink down to the next line on the glass. If the drinker failed to reach the line level, the reveler would be required to drink down to the next ring.<br><br>Only when the drinker had drunk successfully to the required line would the glass be passed on to the next participant.

De Hooch worked in the city of Delft from about 1652 to 1660.<br><br>His work showed astute observation of the details of everyday life and exhibited a sophisticated treatment of light similar to those of Vermeer, who lived in Delft at the same time as de Hooch. <br><br>De Hooch painted everyday scenes in which his compositions emphasized the geometry of architectural elements. The doors, windows, and shutters, floor tiles, and bricks were all carefully detailed.<br></p>');
