document.write('<p class="mFontSizeSColor" />By Raphael. The “Small Cowper Madonna” depicts Mary and the Christ Child, with a 1500s Italian countryside as the background. It was painted around 1505 during the High Renaissance. The composition is centered on the seated Madonna in a bright red dress; she is shown with fair skin and blonde hair. She is sitting comfortably on a wooden bench, and across her lap is a dark blue drapery upon which her right hand delicately rests. There is also a sheer translucent ribbon elegantly flowing across the top of her dress and behind her head. The faintest golden halo miraculously surrounds her head. In her left hand, she holds the baby Christ, who embraces her with one arm around her back, the other around her neck. He also has blonde hair and is looking back over his shoulder with a coy smile.<br><br>Behind Mary and the Christ Child is a clear and bright day with a lake on the left in the background, and on the right is a large impressive structure that looks like a Catholic church. Its dome and other structural elements are typical to Catholic architecture, which all add to the atmosphere of religious divinity and grace. It is not known precisely why the Small Cowper Madonna was painted. It was probably either a private commission or for the general art market. Images of the Madonna and Child were often given as wedding presents. It is widely thought that the church on the right-hand side of the painting is the church of San Bernardino, where Raphael was born and near where he grew up in Urbino. In this painting, Raphael expresses the influence of Leonardo in a broad, soft landscape.<br><br>This painting is known as the “Small Cowper Madonna” because it was the smaller of the two Raphael Madonna paintings owned by the English collector Lord Cowper (1738 -1789). The Large Cowper Madonna is also known as the “Niccolini-Cowper Madonna” it is more extensive and depicts Mary and Child, against a darker blue sky. Cowper’s art collection absorbed a great deal of his time and money, and his most valuable possessions were the two Raphael Madonnas acquired in the late 1700s. Today, both of these Raphael masterpieces are in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.</p>');
